# Dyson School of Design Engineering Machine Learning Elective

## Lab 1
Objectives:
1. Understand and code a simple neuron
2. Understand how a neuron learns
3. Understand its limitations

Other learning points:
- Deriving the error function - NEED TO FINISH THIS
- Finding the learning rate
- Maximum accuracy for a single neuron emulating XOR.

## Lab 2
Objectives:
1. Understand Backpropagation
2. Write a neural network with one or more hidden layers
3. Solve the XOR
4. Understand how to build general classifiers

## Lab 3
Objectives:
1. Understand how to use Pytorch to write a Neural Network
2. Write a neural network with multiple hidden layers

I followed the PyTorch tutorials to help with understanding before the tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html. 

## Assignment 1

Wrote a critique on the paper _"Artificial intelligence in healthcare: past, present and future"_ by Jiang et al.
